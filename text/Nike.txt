<h3>Summary</h3>
Going into the Nike visit, I wasn’t exactly sure what to expect. It was our first visit of the trip, so I wasn’t sure exactly what type of things we would be doing during the visit. I also wasn’t too interested in Nike at first. I had of course knew of the company, but it just didn’t strike me as an innovative company or one that I might be very interested in. Again, my expectations were completely wrong.

When I stepped foot inside of Steve Prefontaine Hall, it was immediately clear how strong the culture at Nike was. The hallway was lined with intense pictures of athletes and the center of the room boasted a large dynamic display of their Team USA colorway for the 2016 Olympics. Off to the side of the main hall was a smaller room which seemed like a “History of Nike” museum. The room featured important Nike relics from the original sketches for the Nike logo to the busted waffle iron used to make the first waffle sole to the actual van that Phil Knight would drive around to track meets and sell Tiger shoes. It was clear that all of these symbols were held in high regard with the company and were more than just relics or exhibits but rather symbols of Nike’s values.

Our first speakers were Ken Cohen, a Maryland grad and long-time Nike employee, and Michelle Thiry, a Nike employee and shoe enthusiast with over 400 pairs of shoes. They went over the early days of Nike as well as some of its more recent growth and the ultimate goal of nearly doubling its revenue to $50 billion in fiscal year 2020. After hearing from Michelle and Ken about Nike’s present, we heard from Nelson Farris, one of the first employees at Nike who worked directly with Phil Knight and Bill Bowerman. After decades with the company, Nelson is still very much involved with Nike and loves his job to this day. Nelson mentioned how the culture at Nike today is still as strong as it was back in the early days. Once the speakers were finished, we were given a tour of the campus and eventually a trip to the highly-anticipated employee store.

<h3>Key Takeaways</h3>
Despite Nike’s worldwide success as an athletic clothing / footwear company, the employees still push themselves to reach goals that seem improbable to outsiders. One of the main tenets of Nike is that there is no finish line. Whether it be on the field or in the corporate world, there is always room for improvement, and people must strive to push themselves past their limits. This is why Nike was regarded as the #1 most innovative company in 2013 by Fast Company magazine. When examining the company and what made it innovative, Fast Company formulated the 4 rules of innovation at Nike. Rule #1: To disrupt, you must go all-in. Nike is certainly unafraid of going all-in. The company has proven this time and time again from when Phil Knight went all-in travelling to Japan and selling Tiger shoes in the United States to when Nike decided to disrupt the way shoes are made with their Flyknit technology.

After hearing from the speakers about the company and its culture, Ken gave us a tour of the massive campus, which holds over 10,000 employees. Even the campus reflects the values and heroes of the company, with every building being named after an important person in Nike’s history and banners of the top athletes all around the campus. The entire headquarters is designed to look and feel like a college campus to foster the same type of innovation and work ethic that can be found at universities.

One of the main lessons I learned from the Nike visit is that innovation can only be bred in an innovative culture and environment. Nike is such a successful company because it has a strong culture of intensity, constant improvement and inclusion. Nike’s main tenet is that “If you have a body, you’re an athlete.” This excludes nobody from innovating and pushing themselves to their limits. The environment at Nike is one that breeds innovation and curiosity through the use of stories / symbols (Museum of Nike), heroes (Phil Knight, Bill Bowerman, professional athletes), and strong slogans.
