<h3>Summary</h3>
As we pulled up to the Starbucks offices, the first thing I noticed was the style of the building. It looked to be an old warehouse converted into an office space and topped with the omnipresent siren logo of the company. After we ate lunch at some of the surrounding food trucks, we met with our tour guides and UMD alumni, Samantha Keshner and Eric Solomon. They showed us around the building (which turned out to actually be a repurposed Sears warehouse) for a while and we passed some of the different special areas of the offices, such as the room where each and every coffee bean is tested for satisfaction in a process called “cupping”. The walls of the offices were filled with designs, graphics, and quotes depicting some of their values and goals. After the tour, we were led into a conference room where we had a quick Q&A with some other Maryland alumni and were taught how to properly taste coffee (which isn’t as easy as you might think).

<h3>Key Takeaways</h3>
When I was looking at the list of companies we would visit on this trip, I honestly didn’t think much of Starbucks at first. I don’t drink much coffee and didn’t know much about the company. This visit, however, turned out to be both intriguing and informative! I was fascinated by how much care and detail goes into each and every cup of coffee and couldn’t even fathom how just one person in the “cupping room” could taste 600 cups of coffee a day.

I was also intrigued by how Starbucks runs and operates as a company. The entire office felt like one big Starbucks shop, and the aroma of coffee followed our group wherever we went. One of the company’s main goals was to become that “third place” that people would go each and every day, with the first and second places being home and work. 
Each and every kitchen was fully equipped with the machines to make every drink on the Starbucks menu; however, almost all employees preferred the actual Starbucks in the building. Starbucks is not just about the coffee. It’s about the consumer experience as well, which I did not realize until this visit. Starbucks and its employees are able to connect with the customers in a way that transcends coffee, which is why it is such a successful and recognized company worldwide. In the book Leading the Starbucks Way, Joseph A. Michelli details the 3 areas in which Starbucks connects with its customers: <br/>
<ul>
<li><b>Design</b>: stores are designed to streamline customer-barista interactions</li>
<li><b>Sensory factors</b>: pleasant artwork, designs, food, and smells are present not only in stores but in the offices as well</li
<li><b>Listening</b>: most importantly, Starbucks genuinely listens to its customers and takes their wishes into considerations</li>
</ul>

Another point discussed by Michelli was actually brought up by Samantha on our tour: “Continually renew the entrepreneurial and innovative spirit that your company had when it was new.” According to Samantha, every so often the company re-evaluates its alignment with its values and mission statement. It is clear that these missions and values are not just boxes to check off but rather actual goals and expectations that are held near and dear to the company.
