<h3>Summary</h3>
While the majority of our visits up until now focused on a specific company and had career advice mixed in throughout, our visit with Gary Swart was entirely focused on personal and professional development. We met with him in a small office building, which made for an intimate environment and made the visit much more engaging. Gary detailed his professional history and how he ended up at the Polaris Partners. His talk covered a wide range of topics but circled around the overarching theme of his 4 things to look for in an opportunity: <br/>
<ul>
<li>Impact</li>
<li>Personal and Professional Growth</li>
<li>Financial Reward</li>
<li>Balance</li>
</ul>
These are the 4 things to consider before making a decision regarding a professional career opportunity. As he went through his career transitions, from working at Pure Software to IBM to being a CEO, he made clear how each of these 4 factored into his decisions. Gary was a captivating speaker and this visit felt like more a conversation than a panel as he kept us engaged and asked us questions as much as we asked him.

<h3>Key Takeaways</h3>
The meeting with Gary was definitely one of the most valuable experiences of the trip. As I mentioned before, it truly felt like a conversation rather than a presentation or panel. It was incredibly interesting to hear the career path that Gary took to go from working at a small software company to being CEO of the largest freelance online employment service in the world, oDesk. His career advice and the 4 things to look for in an opportunity will definitely stay with me for a while as I make the transition from college to the professional world. As I was typing up this reflection, I felt the need to email Gary and thank him for his time and his invaluable advice, and I only wish I had sent him an email sooner.

The main takeaway I got from this experience was that no matter how shiny and attractive an opportunity may seem, there are certain things that must be considered before impulsively pulling the trigger or deciding to stay or leave a position. While working at Rational Software, Gary was offered the position as employee #3 at Netflix. While it seems like a no-brainer choice now, there was a lot to consider at the time. Netflix was just a budding company and not the household name that it is today. Gary decided to stay with Rational simply because they offered him more money, impact, growth, and a better balance. After Rational was acquired by IBM, Gary left the massive company because he felt like a cog in the machine and wasn’t making enough of an impact and wanted more personal and professional growth. While holding the CEO position at oDesk, he decided that at this stage of his life, being a CEO didn’t offer the type of balance he wanted, so he left to join the VC community.

Another interesting note was that almost all of these switches was a “career reboot”. It wasn’t a random switch from career to career (such as programmer to farmer to banker) but rather a calculated pivot (programmer to startup founder to CEO to venture capitalist). This is another intriguing concept that Gary said was definitely a calculated decision. Each of his major career moves have been career reboots which have allowed him to continue growing and making an impact in his new fields. As I enter the professional world, I will certainly keep Gary’s advice in mind.
