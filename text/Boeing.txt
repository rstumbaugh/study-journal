<h3>Summary</h3>
At Boeing, the first thing I noticed was the size of the building. Even from the highway, I was simply floored at the scale of the monstrous factory. I had no idea just how big it was until we went inside, where we met with Maryland alum Shauna Bassett and got a tour of the factory. We got to see planes in all stages of production, from fully assembled planes to planes awaiting painting to others that were just a collection of parts waiting to be put together. What struck me the most was the scale of everything; massive cranes were hung from the massive ceiling to move massive pieces of metal to construct massive planes. It was truly unlike anything I’ve ever seen before, and I only wish we were allowed to take photos while we were inside.

<h3>Key Takeaways</h3>
While we didn’t get to hear as much about how the company actually runs and the culture as we did at other places, the visit to Boeing was still incredibly beneficial and informative nonetheless. <img src="img/boeing-planes.jpg" style="float:right;height:350px;">Before visiting the factory, I truly had no idea how planes were made and the exact scale of these monstrous machines. Seeing a plane on the runway and standing right next to one are two completely different feelings. This visit exposed me to a unique industry that I had genuinely never experienced before. Boeing is at the top of the food chain when it comes to plane production, rivaled only by Airbus. It was interesting to hear the intricacies in the differences between Boeing and Airbus planes, specifically the A380, Airbus’ answer to the 787 Dreamliner. The Dreamliner is the dominant plane, as the A380 is much too large and doesn’t fit very well in most airports; in fact, just to fit the A380 in an airport often requires a reconfiguration of the ports in most cases.

The visit to Boeing was one of my favorite stops along the tour for reasons very different from the other companies. I was shown behind the scenes of an industry I had never been exposed to before, and learned about problems in aviation that I never knew existed, such as the fact that red paint is considerably heavier than other shades, and that needs to be taken into account when coming up with designs. The trip to Boeing was unlike any other, and I’m glad we were able to make this stop while on the West Coast.
