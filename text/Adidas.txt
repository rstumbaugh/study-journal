<h3>Summary</h3>
After we visited the Nike World Headquarters and employee store, we headed directly to downtown Portland to visit the adidas North America Headquarters where we met with Rich Roberson, a Senior Patent Counsel for the shoe and clothing company. First, Rich gave us a tour of the campus and the various buildings. Though not nearly as big as Nike’s World HQ, the buildings were unique and had a campus-like feel similar to that of Nike’s. One of the first sights we saw was a mock track / basketball court where they use real athletes and pressure plates in the floor to determine which part of the foot takes the most impact, stress, needs the most support, etc. As we continued through the buildings, we passed different exhibits containing influential and important shoes, most notably the Stan Smiths and the Superstars. We also got a chance to see the Social Media department, where employees are responsible for running all social media accounts for adidas. As we toured the campus, Rich gave us some insight as to some of adidas’ successes and failures as well as some challenges they face, such as copyright issues with Skechers. We ended the trip with a visit to the adidas employee store and kicked around a high-tech soccer ball with Rich on the turf field adidas has on campus.

<h3>Key Takeaways</h3>
What struck me the most about adidas was how much different the feel of the company was than Nike. Two companies that are so strongly associated with each other as bitter competitors could not have more different cultures. Nike has a very strong and prominent culture that was evident in every part of the campus. adidas, however, had a much more laid-back atmosphere throughout the buildings. I was also intrigued by how much direct science and engineering goes into each shoe and it was interesting to get a glimpse of the experiments behind them.

I also found it interesting how often Rich mentioned competitors such as Nike and especially Under Armour. At Nike, we rarely heard comments about competitors unless a student asked about them whereas at adidas Rich mentioned the competition a few times with regard to why adidas makes the decisions they make and how the competition influences the company. He also spoke about Under Armour hiring employees from adidas and Nike in an attempt to innovate the way these companies innovate.

An effective way adidas has been innovating recently is through speed and agility. CEO of adidas America Mark King believes that speed can be a real differentiator in the marketplace. A large company like adidas can easily be bogged down with corporate red tape when a new idea or disruption is thought up. However, King believes that it is important to move quickly and fail fast. As an example used by Forbes, Senior Design Director Katie Becker approached King with the idea of a new line called adi Girl. In less than six weeks, the adi Girl line was being sold to a “major account” successfully. In less than six weeks, a new idea was fully implemented at a huge multinational company. The idea of being quick, agile, and responsive in the marketplace is an important concept and will aid adidas in the future.

One final note that I found interesting about adidas is the Kanye West sponsorship. I asked Rich whether or not he thought that sponsoring Kanye West revitalized the company while it was in a slump, and he immediately responded with an affirmative. Nike gains most of its brand recognition through professional athlete sponsorship. adidas, while also trying to tap this market, is making a transition from an athletic brand to a lifestyle brand with the Yeezy line. The Yeezy line is a very limited and sought-after line of shoes that has generated an incredible amount of interest in the company with such a high-profile endorsement like Kanye West. I am curious to see if adidas makes any future endorsements in an effort to move into the lifestyle / streetwear market as well as the athletic space.
