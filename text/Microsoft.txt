<h3>Summary</h3>
While at Microsoft, we got a chance to hear from some UMD alumni as well as Mukund Mohan, Director of Engineering and Strategy for their Cloud division. Mukund was also Director of Microsoft Ventures, the company’s venture capital arm. Mukund was an incredibly captivating speaker, and he told us about recent changes in Microsoft’s culture. He feels that in the past, they were much too competitive. Nowadays, the culture has shifted towards collaboration rather than competition. This was definitely interesting to her after seeing companies like Nike, whose culture revolves around intensity and friendly competition. After Mukund spoke, we heard from some Maryland alumni who were active in all parts of Microsoft, from software development to the business side of things. After the alumni panel, we got to spend some time in an exhibit of some of their new technology including the Xbox and Windows phones.

<h3>Key Takeaways</h3>
The visit to Microsoft was certainly an interesting one. What I found most intriguing about the company was the different branches that I was completely unaware of until this visit. Before hearing Mukund speak, I had no idea that Microsoft even had a venture capital division, or that they were involved in cloud operations. Mukund was a fascinating speaker who was clearly well-learned and had lots of experience both in tech and business. A look at his LinkedIn profile shows that he has been the founder and/or CEO of a number of startup companies. One of Mukund’s biggest messages was to fail often and keep growing. Whenever one of his companies failed, he would start a new one. Fail fast and fail often, Mukund advised. This is a line I have heard many times from many sources, whether it be speakers out on this trip or in books we’ve read in BMGT289B.

Mukund’s personal blog, “Best Engaging Communities”, offers some interesting and useful advice. One of his pages, titled “I Believe”, features a list of 18 quotes and snippets that he personally believes in. They range from startup advice to general business advice. One of them in particular I found quite thought-provoking:

<br/><br/>

<blockquote>
Every morning in Africa, a gazelle wakes up, it knows it must outrun the fastest lion or it will be killed. Every morning in Africa, a lion wakes up. It knows it must run faster than the slowest gazelle, or it will starve. It doesn’t matter whether you’re the lion or a gazelle - when the sun comes up, you’d better be running.

<b>- Christopher McDougall, <i>Born to Run</i></b>
</blockquote>

The essence of the quote is that it doesn’t necessarily matter what your end goal is; whether you’re a predator or prey, action is always better than inaction. I understood the quote a bit better after reading the article “Ahead of the Pack” by <i>Fast Company</i>. In this article, Mukund talks about how small teams in a startup environment are often more effective than large teams simply because they move faster and are willing to take more risks.

The idea of moving quickly and being swift and agile is one that we have heard before from other speakers on this trip - it is clear that this advice is generally accepted knowledge out in Silicon Valley and the startup community.

The visit with Mukund and Microsoft taught me a lot about the startup community, with which I have little to no experience. It was a valuable visit and I’m certainly glad we were able to make this stop.
