<h3>Conclusion</h3>
Going into this trip, I knew it would be a valuable experience. I knew I was going to make some great connections and see some interesting companies and have a good time on the West Coast. What I did not know, however, was the extent to which all of my hopes and expectations would be fulfilled. Reflecting back on this trip, I was completely blown away by each and every aspect. In addition to just being a fun week out West, I got to meet so many people from such a wide variety of companies and make incredible connections. I have emailed a number of employees that we met with such as Ken Cohen at Nike and John Spruill at Tesla, both of whom have responded to me. John actually got back to me today and was able to put me in touch with their University Recruiter, with whom I will reconnect in January to discuss summer internship opportunities.

In addition to making connections, I learned more in one week than I ever thought possible. I was able to see a wide variety of companies, industries, and cultures, and I got an overall feel of the work ideology of Silicon Valley and the West Coast. From the laid back feel of Adidas to the intense, competitive nature of Nike to the “high-performance environment” at Netflix, I was able to see a wide range of cultures and atmospheres.

I learned many valuable lessons from this trip. One of the lessons that I feel is the most important as I enter the professional world is this: Judge the employer just as much as they judge you. I first heard this lesson from Gary Swart, and it was reiterated by Kate Kepler at Intel. Just because a company has a big name and it offers a great financial reward doesn’t necessarily make it a great opportunity. As a fresh college grad, of course the big-name companies will be enticing. They will look great on a resume and I’ll be able to tell people I work at X Company or Y startup. That doesn’t necessarily mean it is the right opportunity for me. As a result, I need to judge the company just as much as it judges me and make sure I take into account the 4 parts of the opportunity: impact, growth, reward, and balance.

Looking back on this trip, I am undoubtedly satisfied at both the entertainment value and educational value. It is tough to put into words just how I feel about the experience and what I learned, but I certainly feel I have changed as a person as a result. I have gained a new outlook on the professional world and feel ready to battle the bear (as Marty Ringlein would say). Many times during this reflection I’ve had to stop myself from writing as I know I would have gone on for pages and pages about some of the takeaways and lessons I’ve learned. As a final note, I’d just like to thank Dr. Wellman and Sean for putting this experience together and making it all possible. Hopefully, I’ll be able to return out to the West Coast one of these days as a part of my professional career.
