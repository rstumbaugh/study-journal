<h3>Summary</h3>
Today, Yannick Spierkel from Cirque du Soleil came in to talk to us about the history of Cirque and a bit about the culture at the unique circus company. Yannick walked us through the timeline of about how long it takes to make a show, which is about 2 years. Cirque recruits from circus schools, circuses, and even Olympic athletes to find performers who can meet the standards of the shows. If I learned anything from this experience, it’s that being a Cirque performer is exhausting. Performers spend 4-6 months before a show training at their HQ and about 1 month before training in on-site dress rehearsals. A typical show will run in a city for 5-8 weeks before moving onto another city, with about a week or two in between shows for the teardown and rebuilding of the sets. While the shows are on, the performers will put on 8-10 shows each week, 6 days a week. Cirque knows just how demanding it is to be an actor, and so do the actors themselves. It truly takes a different breed of people to be an actor.

Yannick also spoke about the culture at Cirque and their Pillars of Engagement, which have a lot to do with ethics and responsibility. Cirque holds its values very highly and will not change any part of the show for any amount of money. A week after hearing from Yannick, we got to see it all in action at a Cirque du Soleil show.

<h3>KURIOS: Cabinet of Curiosities</h3>
From Yannick’s presentation, I knew that Cirque du Soleil would be unlike anything I had ever seen before. It wasn’t until I was sitting under the big top, however, that I truly understood what he meant. <img src="img/cirque.jpg" style="float:left;height:300px;">The show was truly unlike anything I had ever experienced. The music, atmosphere, costumes, and, of course, the performances were incredibly gripping, and I was immediately sucked into the show. Cirque did a fantastic job of making me forget reality for a while and question what was really possible. The show was truly unlike any other circus, and I definitely hope to get a chance to see another show!

<h3>Key Takeaways</h3>
“Impossible is only a word.” These were the words on the last slide of Yannick’s presentation. I didn’t think much of it at first, but those words popped into my head as I was walking out of the big top after the show. While witnessing these acrobatic feats, I was completely in awe at the tricks, stunts, and contortions that these actors were performing. I was questioning what was real and what was not throughout the entire show. What made everything more enjoyable was that the actors themselves were clearly having as much fun as we were. They truly loved their job, and it was very obvious to see. One of my favorite acts of the show was when they replicated a dinner scene that was taking place on the ground on the top of the stage upside-down, and it looked like a mirror image of everything taking place.

Seeing a Cirque du Soleil show, above all else, made me grow a strong appreciation for the arts. All my life, I have been more geared towards technical subjects like math and science. This show showed me a new form of expression I had never experienced before and likely never will again (unless I see another Cirque show!). Like all other aspects of this Study Tour, I was completely blown away by the experience and feeling very fortunate that I was able to attend.
