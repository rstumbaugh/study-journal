<h3>Summary</h3>
Today, Marty Ringlein came in to speak to us about general career advice and how to battle the “bear” that is the professional world. Marty is a credible source on career advice, to say the least; he is a designer with experience at Apple, Twitter, and The White House. He began the talk with an analogy comparing the professional world, the competition, and yourself with Leo DiCaprio and the bear in <i>The Revenant</i>. His main point was that Leo is clearly more prepared than we are to fight a bear; in the movie, he was equipped with gear and had much more experience. Put simply, he was ready. But does “ready” necessarily mean prepared? Just because he seems more prepared doesn’t make him more prepared than we are to battle a bear. In the movie, Leo ends up getting mauled by the bear. It looks like we didn’t have to outrun the bear, but we just had to outrun Leo, who would have been weighed down by all of his gear that was supposed to make him so “prepared”.

After his bear analogy, Marty went on to discuss some of his thoughts on innovation and “thinking different”. Marty proposed that if everyone thinks different, then everyone ends up thinking the same. And if 2 men in business always agree with each other, one is irrelevant. While I do agree with this last part, I don’t necessarily with his sentiment about thinking different. Nevertheless, hearing from Marty was a valuable experience and he did have some great advice to help us out in the future in addition to being a captivating speaker.

<h3>Key Takeaways</h3>
Marty was a captivating speaker and had some very good advice and comments on innovation and how to separate yourself from the pack. At the very beginning of his presentation, his main point was that the competition will always be more prepared. As I apply for internships and job opportunities, I often get the feeling that I’m not prepared enough compared to the competition. It was definitely a relief to hear some of these feelings validated by such a successful person!

Later in the presentation, Marty made some great points about innovation and success. His presentation slides were plain and simple, with few words on them aside from quotes. One of the slides that stuck with me said “How do innovators think? Not like you.” To truly be an innovator, you must think different from everyone else. While this sounds a bit contradictory to what he talked about earlier with regard to thinking differently, his main point by this slide was that an innovator doesn’t just think differently. An innovator thinks in such a unique way that it can’t really be compared to anything else. Marty continued with saying that innovation doesn’t come easy to anyone. Innovation is terrifying, unresearchable, and unpredictable. As I move forward in my professional career after school, I will need to learn to step outside my comfort zone much more than I ever have in the past. To innovate is to be vulnerable. I am typically the type of person who prefers calculated decisions and surefire solutions rather than uncharted territory. In order to innovate, I must let go of these habits and step outside of my comfort zone.

In terms of advice for the future, Marty’s key advice was to be proactive. Similar to Kate Kepler’s ideology about marketing at Intel, it is much better to be proactive rather than reactive to the competition. Marty said to really try and think about what the competition will do and do it first. His startup that he is working at now is a ticket sales service, and of course his main competition is large behemoth companies like Ticketmaster. In this situation, Ticketmaster is the Leo DiCaprio, and Marty’s company has the advantage of being small and agile enough to make quick decisions and move fast. Hearing from Marty was a great experience and, once again, I continue to be incredibly satisfied with the Study Tour weeks after we have returned.
