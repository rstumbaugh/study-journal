<h3>Summary</h3>
Our last stop on the tour was Netflix, where we met with 2012 UMD grad Andrew Park. Andrew spoke a lot about Netflix as a business and the culture / work life at the company. He cleared up a few misconceptions regarding how Netflix perceives itself (as a tech company that just happens to focus on original content rather than a movie streaming service). One of the biggest points Andrew made was just how much independence Netflix gives their employees. Andrew is responsible for their Amazon Cloud operations and purchases hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of server space every week with almost 0 oversight. Every Netflix employee, according to Andrew, has the power to log on and shut down their entire servers. Netflix treats its employees like adults, and gives them full responsibility to do whatever they want to do. In addition to incredible responsibility, Netflix treats its employees very well, with unlimited vacation time and a minimum of 4 months severance pay. Their motto is that at Netflix, money should never be an issue. After telling us about their content delivery service and the company culture, Andrew gave us a quick tour of the campus and joined us for dinner afterwards.

<h3>Key Takeaways</h3>
The culture at Netflix was very different from any other company culture we had seen before on this trip. If I had to describe the Netflix culture in one word, it would be <b>intense</b>. Andrew noted that as a part of having a large amount of responsibility, employees are to be held accountable for their work 24/7. As a developer, Andrew is on 24/7 pager service; if something in his code breaks or a bug is found, he is expected to be ready to fix it, no matter where he is. Although Netflix gives its employees unlimited vacation days, Andrew admitted that not many take much vacation time due to having to constantly be accessible via email or cell phone and being ready to work at a moment’s notice. While the long days and intense environment may be fitting for some, it would certainly not be my ideal work culture. As Gary Swart would say, it does not provide the ideal balance for me. As a result of this “high-performance culture” as Andrew described it, Netflix has an incredibly high talent density; most, if not all, developers have at least a Masters and typically a Ph. D. as well.

Andrew also talked about exactly how Netflix delivers content to different devices via its streaming service. Most of the actual Netflix application and platform is contained on Amazon Web Services server space in the cloud, while the actual content is contained on OpenConnect boxes that are located all over the world. Ther in-house OpenConnect boxes provide an advantage over AWS for content as it allows them to optimize the servers and send very specialized content. Andrew compared this to trying to ship a tank; obviously, FedEx is not the service you would use to ship a tank. You would need a more optimized and specialized service to get the job done. As a software dev, this concept was very interesting to me. Performance, especially with streaming media, is definitely the top priority in terms of user experience. These OpenConnect boxes give Netflix a unique way to optimize and specialize their machines for the content they have.

Going into this visit, I thought I would love Netflix and its organizational culture. While listening to Andrew talk, however, it sounds like the exact opposite type of culture I would want in a company. Evidently, a good work / life balance is very important to me and my decisions, as I learned from Gary Swart. While Netflix may be the ideal place for some, it is certainly not a place I would like to work.
