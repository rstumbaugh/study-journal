<h3>Summary</h3>
While visiting Intel, we heard from UMD alumni and Intel employee of over 20 years, Kate Kepler. She spoke a lot about the company in general and some of its biggest revenue sources, such as the backbones for the Internet of Things and their different models of processors, and she wrapped things up with some general professional career advice. <img src="img/intel.jpg" style="float:left;height:400px;"> Kate is a Marketing Director for Intel, so we also got a chance to see some of their more recent and creative advertising spots. After getting her MBA from Maryland in 1995, she started working at Intel and has been there ever since. Kate addressed some of the problems that Intel faced, such as not appealing to millennials as much as the older age groups and how they can get more recognition and publicity for some of the lesser known aspects of the company, such as their conflict-free materials and sustainability efforts. Kate also talked about the culture at Intel, which, from her description, she represented quite well. It definitely seemed like a strong culture that was held in high regard by the employees.

<h3>Key Takeaways</h3>
Most of the speakers we had heard from up until now were fairly formal, with some more relaxed than others. Kate, on the other hand, was on the complete opposite end of the spectrum. She swore multiple times during the presentation, and she was very <i>very</i> casual and relaxed for the duration of our visit. This was surprising to see, as when I think of Intel, I think of an older, “boring” company with not much going on. Interestingly enough, Kate mentioned this is a problem that Intel continues to face. The older generations know Intel as the company that is behind almost every computer, while the millennials aren’t as familiar with the company and its culture.

The culture of Intel was much different from what I was expecting, to say the least. They have a very strong culture, and most if not all employees are very bold and decisive, reminiscent of the bold and fearless culture at Tesla. Throughout the meeting, Kate preached that it was much better to “make a call and correct it later” than suffer paralysis by analysis. My tennis coach used to use that phrase all the time: paralysis by analysis. It’s much worse to spend too much time analyzing something that you are paralyzed into inaction than to make a bad decision, and it’s clear that the principle applies in the business world as well. The culture is so strong and prevalent, Kate said, that they had to fire the former Chief Marketing Officer at Samsung shortly after they brought him on board because he couldn’t integrate into the culture very well. New employees are given an Intel integration handbook which tells them about the culture and what it’s like to work at Intel.

One aspect I thought was interesting was that throughout the presentation, Kate didn’t talk about the competition much, and she even pointed this out herself.  <img src="img/intel-book.jpg" style="float:right;height:300px;">When asked why, she said it is much better to be proactive rather than reactive in marketing. Instead of follow the marketing trends and respond to what others are doing, Intel strives to be the trendsetter.

Many of the beliefs and values that Kate mentioned Intel held in high regard weren’t very complicated or farfetched. Simple ideas such as treat employees well, do the right things right, and make something better every day were some of Intel’s most highly-regarded values. Similar to what we had heard at other companies, these values seem to preach the idea that it’s better to make successive smaller improvements rather than to continuously churn out brand new, disruptive ideas. 
Overall, I was pleasantly surprised by the visit to Intel. It was a company that I did not know much about, which I found surprising considering how prevalent they are in the computing industry. I learned a lot about the fast-paced culture of the company and, while it might not be one that appeals to me very much, it was a great experience to gain more exposure to the different types of cultures and companies in the tech world.
